Project Statement
Problem Statement
Traditional health monitoring often requires manual measurement and timely access to health parameters like heart rate and body temperature, which can lead to delayed detection of health abnormalities. Many users lack a simple, real-time, and accessible way to monitor their vital signs and receive alerts if readings fall outside the healthy range. This project addresses the need for a basic, user-friendly health monitoring system that can assist individuals in tracking their heart rate and temperature with immediate feedback and logging capabilities.

Scope of the Project
This project is designed to provide a console-based health monitoring system that accepts inputs for heart rate and body temperature, validates these values against medically accepted thresholds, and generates alerts for abnormal readings. It logs all sessions for review and reports the findings at the end of the monitoring period. The system is modular and scalable for future enhancements like adding more health parameters or integrating file-based storage.

Target Users
Individuals wanting basic self-monitoring of vital health parameters at home or work.
Healthcare beginners or students learning about health data-handling and basic programming.
Developers looking for a modular Python-based health monitoring framework.
Small clinics or institutions needing a simple health check tool without sophisticated hardware.

High-Level Features
Input interface for heart rate (bpm) and temperature (°C) via console.
Validation of vital signs against standard healthy thresholds.
Immediate alerts for out-of-range heart rate or temperature values.
Logging of all readings and alerts during a session.
Display of a detailed session report on program termination.
Modular code structure with separate components for input handling, checking, logging, reporting, and control.
